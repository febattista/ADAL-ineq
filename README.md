# ADAL-ineq
Extended ADAL for Maximum Clique and Graph Coloring problems
------------------------------------------------------------

The present software package includes scripts for solving
SDP problems in general form:

         min <C,X> 
         s.t. <Ai,X> <= bi, i=1,...,l;
              <Aj,X>  = bj, j=l+1,...,m;
              X >= L
              X psd
         
In particular it contains the ADMM for large-scale SDPs in general form and the post-processing 
procedure able to compute a valid bound on the primal optimal value detailed in the manuscript:

Federico Battista, Marianna De Santis "Dealing with inequality constraints in large scale 
                                       semidefinite relaxations for graph coloring and maximum 
                                       clique problems"

The MAIN code for the Alternating Direction Augmented Lagrangian is
  
  * ADALplus_bounds.m 

N.B. the dual bound procedure calls the LP solver of Gurobi.
     You need to install Gurobi in order to run it
